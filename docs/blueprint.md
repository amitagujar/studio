# **App Name**: Chameleon Chat

## Core Features:

- Custom API Integration: Provide a custom API link to fetch chat history, allowing users to load previous conversations from their preferred source.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#9400D3) to convey sophistication. Violet suggests both royalty and innovation, and also suggests a calming and aesthetically beautiful presence.
- Background color: Light violet (#F0E6FF), a very lightly saturated pastel which is visually related to the primary color. A light theme works better than a dark one when readability is a paramount concern.
- Accent color: Light pink (#FF69B4) for highlights and interactive elements; being close to the primary on the color wheel creates harmony, while the boosted brightness and saturation creates contrast.
- Clean and modern typography for readability and a contemporary feel.
- Simple, outlined icons for common chat actions like send, delete, and edit.
- A clean, intuitive layout with a clear separation between the chat input area and message display.
